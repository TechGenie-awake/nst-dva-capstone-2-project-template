## Before You Start

1. Rename the repository using the format `SectionName_TeamID_ProjectName`.
2. Fill in the project details and team table below.
3. Add the raw dataset to `data/raw/`.
4. Complete the notebooks in order from `01` to `05`.
5. Publish the final dashboard and add the public link in `tableau/dashboard_links.md`.
6. Export the final report and presentation as PDFs into `reports/`.

### Quick Start

If you are working locally:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

If you are working in Google Colab:

- Upload or sync the notebooks from `notebooks/`
- Keep the final `.ipynb` files committed to GitHub
- Export any cleaned datasets into `data/processed/`

## Business Problem

A UK-based online gift retailer serves both individual shoppers and wholesale buyers across 30+ countries. Like most mid-sized e-commerce businesses, its marketing and retention spend is currently distributed evenly across the customer base — meaning low-value customers receive the same treatment as the small group driving most of the revenue, while high-value customers slip silently toward churn without targeted intervention. This project segments the active customer base using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to identify the segments worth protecting and the segments worth re-engaging, so the retention budget can be reallocated where it returns the most.

**Core Business Question**

> Which customer segments drive the most revenue, which are at the highest risk of churn, and where should retention spend be reallocated to recover lost value over the next 12 months?

**Decision Supported**

> Reallocation of retention and marketing campaign budget across customer segments — including which segments to reward, which to win back, and which to deprioritize — to reduce 12-month customer churn by 10–15% and lift repeat-purchase revenue from the top-quartile segment.

## Dataset

| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|
| **Source Name** | UCI Machine Learning Repository (donor: Daqing Chen, Sept 2019); accessed via Kaggle mirror `mashlyn/online-retail-ii-uci` |
| **Direct Access Link** | https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii |
| **Row Count** | 1,067,371 |
| **Column Count** | 8 |
| **Time Period Covered** | December 1, 2009 – December 9, 2011 |
| **Format** | CSV (committed as 15 MB compressed ZIP at `data/raw/online_retail_II.zip`) |

**Key Columns Used**

| Column Name | Description | Role in Analysis |
|---|---|---|
| InvoiceNo | Six-digit transaction ID; `C` prefix = cancellation | Returns/cancellation analysis, transaction-level KPIs |
| InvoiceDate | Transaction timestamp | RFM Recency, time-series trends, dashboard filter |
| Quantity | Units purchased per transaction | Revenue computation, returns flagging |
| UnitPrice | Price per unit (GBP) | Revenue computation, RFM Monetary |
| CustomerID | Five-digit customer ID (~25% missing) | RFM segmentation, churn analysis (excluded if null) |
| Country | Customer's country of residence | Geographic dashboard filter, regional KPIs |
| StockCode | Five-digit product ID | Product-level analysis (excluded for non-product codes) |
| Description | Product name (free text) | Tableau filter, product-level reporting |

For full column definitions, see [`docs/data_dictionary.md`](docs/data_dictionary.md).

## KPI Framework

| KPI | Definition | Formula / Computation |
|---|---|---|
| Active Customer Count | Customers with ≥1 purchase in trailing 12 months | `nunique(CustomerID where InvoiceDate >= max_date - 365 days)` |
| Average Order Value (AOV) | Average revenue per invoice | `sum(Quantity * UnitPrice) / nunique(InvoiceNo)` |
| Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) | Total spend per customer over the dataset period | `sum(Quantity * UnitPrice) group by CustomerID` |
| 90-Day Churn Rate | Share of customers with no purchase in last 90 days | `count(CustomerID where recency_days > 90) / count(CustomerID)` |
| Revenue Concentration (Top 20%) | Revenue share of the top quintile of customers | `sum(revenue of top 20% of CustomerIDs by CLV) / sum(total revenue)` |
| Repeat Purchase Rate | Share of customers with ≥2 distinct invoices | `count(CustomerID with frequency >= 2) / count(CustomerID)` |
| Country Revenue Mix | Revenue share per country | `sum(revenue) group by Country / sum(total revenue)` |

Document KPI logic clearly in `notebooks/04_statistical_analysis.ipynb` and `notebooks/05_final_load_prep.ipynb`.

## Analytical Pipeline

The project follows a structured 7-step workflow:

1. **Define** - Sector selected, problem statement scoped, mentor approval obtained.
2. **Extract** - Raw dataset sourced and committed to `data/raw/`; data dictionary drafted.
3. **Clean and Transform** - Cleaning pipeline built in `notebooks/02_cleaning.ipynb` and optionally `scripts/etl_pipeline.py`.
4. **Analyze** - EDA and statistical analysis performed in notebooks `03` and `04`.
5. **Visualize** - Interactive Tableau dashboard built and published on Tableau Public.
6. **Recommend** - 3-5 data-backed business recommendations delivered.
7. **Report** - Final project report and presentation deck completed and exported to PDF in `reports/`.
